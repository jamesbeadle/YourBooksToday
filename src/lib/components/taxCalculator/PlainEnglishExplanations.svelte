		{ question: 'What’s the cash basis?', answer: 'You count income when the money arrives and expenses when you pay them — not when an invoice is sent. It’s the default for most sole traders and subcontractors.' },
		{ question: 'How is mileage worked out?', answer: 'With HMRC’s simplified rates: a flat amount per business mile covering fuel, repairs, insurance and wear, claimed instead of your actual vehicle costs.' },
		{ question: 'What’s the trading allowance?', answer: `Up to ${formatWholePounds(tradingAllowanceRules.allowance)} of self-employed income is tax-free. You can use it instead of your expenses, not as well — we pick whichever is better for you.` },
		{ question: 'What’s Class 1 National Insurance?', answer: `What employees pay through PAYE: ${formatPercentage(class1.mainRate)} on pay between ${formatWholePounds(class1.lowerLimit)} and ${formatWholePounds(class1.upperLimit)}, then ${formatPercentage(class1.additionalRate)} above.` },
		{ question: 'What’s Class 4 National Insurance?', answer: `What the self-employed pay on profits: ${formatPercentage(class4.mainRate)} between ${formatWholePounds(class4.lowerLimit)} and ${formatWholePounds(class4.upperLimit)}, then ${formatPercentage(class4.additionalRate)} above. It’s paid through Self Assessment with your income tax.` },
		{ question: 'How does pension tax relief work here?', answer: 'Workplace pensions come off your pay before income tax. For a personal pension you pay 80% and the government adds 20%; higher-rate relief comes back through Self Assessment.' }
